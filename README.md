# Sudoku Solver

> This small Typescript application will solve a Sudoku puzzle based upon a grid containing the starting numbers.

> Version 0.1

## Running the application

> Open the HTML page sudoku.html in a browser
> This will prefill with an example starting point.
> Adjust the values as required and press Solve.
> one of five demos can be loaded by picking a the relevant value from the drop down and clicking "Load Demo".
> If there are multiple solutions it will list them on the right hand side, allowing the user to select the solution and view it.
> The first solution will always be displayed after pressing solve.

## In Progress

> The code currently performs the solving of Sudoku puzzles and includes the ability to load a demo puzzle to solve.
> The code also includes an incomplete class (GenerateSudoko) that is to generate new sudoku puzzles. Currently this
> generates a random seed for a Sudoku puzzle by filling in 3 unrelated 3 by 3 grids on the puzzle then solving it.
> Still to do is to then remove random values until we get to a point where we have a single solution.
