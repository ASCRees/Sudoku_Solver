# Sudoku Solver

> This small application will solve a sudoku puzzle based upon a grid containing the starting numbers
> This is written in Typescript

> Version 0.1

## Running the application

> Open the HTML page sudoku.html in a browser
> This will prefill with an example starting point.
> Adjust the values as required and press Solve.
> "Load Demo" will load a sample starting point that has multiple solutions.
> After the Sudoku has been solved if there are multiple possible solution they will be listed on the right,
> allowing the user to select the solution and view it.
> The first solution will always be displayed after pressing solve.

## In Progress

> The code currently performs the solving of Sudoku puzzles and includes the ability to load a demo puzzle to solve.
> The code also includes an incomplete class (GenerateSudoko) that is to generate new sudoku puzzles. Currently this
> generates a random seed for a Sudoku puzzle by filling in 3 unrelated 3 by 3 grids on the puzzle then solving it.
> Still to do is to then remove random values until we get to a point where we have a single solution.
